The central height is the main feature of the house, which is nothing more than a few rooms around a precise void.',

The first action is of economical and cultural nature: a bottom-up partial change of crops and cultivations practiced on the land.  Considering the important economic value of new chosen varieties, the change will bring new expertise and richness to the rural sphere of the La Bazana and will characterise the village with a strong landscape identity, just like la Pronvece region in south France.The second action once more designs the landscape and brings together all the different natural scenarios of the region. A continuous ring serves as cycle line for a slow mobility and an almost educational walk through the dry lands and lavender fields, the wet lands and aromatic fields, the dehesa woods, the Ardila riverbeds.The third and most affective action is of urban character and designs the future expansions of La Bazana Village. The Front Line project is a non-building that extends for 760 linear meters and has a 9 meter wide section, adapting to the natural topography of the hilly side. It is first of all a linear path way, an urban corridor, a slow infrastructure for daily strolls; and secondly an outline limit for future expansions, to be filled with units according to the village’s growth and needs.',
