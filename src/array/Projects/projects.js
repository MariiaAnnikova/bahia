The first action is of economical and cultural nature: a bottom-up partial change of crops and cultivations practiced on the land.  Considering the important economic value of new chosen varieties, the change will bring new expertise and richness to the rural sphere of the La Bazana and will characterise the village with a strong landscape identity, just like la Pronvece region in south France.The second action once more designs the landscape and brings together all the different natural scenarios of the region. A continuous ring serves as cycle line for a slow mobility and an almost educational walk through the dry lands and lavender fields, the wet lands and aromatic fields, the dehesa woods, the Ardila riverbeds.The third and most affective action is of urban character and designs the future expansions of La Bazana Village. The Front Line project is a non-building that extends for 760 linear meters and has a 9 meter wide section, adapting to the natural topography of the hilly side. It is first of all a linear path way, an urban corridor, a slow infrastructure for daily strolls; and secondly an outline limit for future expansions, to be filled with units according to the village’s growth and needs.',

        description: 'In 1928 the german architect and philosopher Herman Sorgel proposed his project for an isolated and lowered mediterranean sea, named Atlantropa. His vision was to close the Strait of Gibraltar with a portentous hydroelectric dam; lock the Suez Canal to the Red Sea; and cut off the Black Sea through the Dardanelles.It was his belief that this international and collective endeavour would bring peace among all the participants once the appearance of new agricultural land came to fruition due to the lowering of the sea levels. Being the son of a hydroelectric engineer, Sorgel thought of Atlantropa as something more than a mere utopia: he studied the construction details and figures of the epic operation for 20 years, and never ceased to strive for its completion. Nearly a century after this meta-continental project was conceptualised, we can attempt to adopt his solution to question the geopolitical borders of contemporary Europe. Focusing on the Strait of Gibraltar, the so called “first world” is separated from the “third world” by a narrow strip of water: a rupture that is not only physical but overall cultural and political.This visual exercise aims at using Sorgel’s historical power dam at the entrance of the Mediterranean to re-question the idea of national and continental frontier between Europe and northern Africa. Could a geophysical border become an architecture to live, a threshold to dwell? Could a power dam become a buffer zone for cultural and social mixitè?From Sorgel’s Atlantropa, to Le Corbusier’s Plan Obus; from Constant’s New Babylon to Kenzo Tange’s Tokyo Bay, the images propose a large infrastructure, prompted by XX century’s utopias and mega projects. A monument that is continuous in its political value and cultural bridging function',
