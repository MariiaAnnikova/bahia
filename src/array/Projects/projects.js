A private house for a family of yogis whose life is entirely dedicated to meditation. The building is a continuous interaction between reserved and defined spaces with larger and open spaces. The central height is the main feature of the house, which is nothing more than a few rooms around a precise void.',

The project of the Cascinassa Wine compound proposes a unitary project of a territorial masterplan, an architectural design of the different new buildings needed in the small existing hamlet, and the single Wine cellar building. The masterplan concentrates all the needed functions in two area, the historical old hamlet and the new representative building for the Cascinassa Wine Company.The historical village becomes now a performative technological hub where the administration offices and daily functions are run. On the other hand, the new building concentrates the wine production, storage and the bottling on the underground level. On the upper level a wine tasting area and reception hall invites the guests to relax and enjoy to the maximum the surrounding views.',

        description: 'Should we meet in the palm oasis? A public square is a public square when it is 100 different squares at once, a hundred different variations and infinite possibilities that ever-change to users’s needs. The project proposes this flexibility with a simple device: a regular grid of 100 steel posts distanced 3 by 3 meters. In between this fix skeleton, steel rods manage shade through sun screens, energy production through photovoltaic panels, temporary exhibitions structures always available. Thus the project proposes two parallel surfaces, the ground and the roof. The soil is first a regular surface, than a topography of rubber for little kids to enjoy and explore. Large Local palm trees and steel posts alternate in creating rhythm and shade for all daily activities, combining the perks of fresh vegetation and the performative characters of technological elements.',

        description: 'The project Esencia Rural 2.0 brings forward (proposes) 3 simultaneous actions in order to activate La Bazana’s rich landscape. The first action is of economical and cultural nature: a bottom-up partial change of crops and cultivations practiced on the land.  Considering the important economic value of new chosen varieties, the change will bring new expertise and richness to the rural sphere of the La Bazana and will characterise the village with a strong landscape identity, just like la Pronvece region in south France.The second action once more designs the landscape and brings together all the different natural scenarios of the region. A continuous ring serves as cycle line for a slow mobility and an almost educational walk through the dry lands and lavender fields, the wet lands and aromatic fields, the dehesa woods, the Ardila riverbeds.The third and most affective action is of urban character and designs the future expansions of La Bazana Village. The Front Line project is a non-building that extends for 760 linear meters and has a 9 meter wide section, adapting to the natural topography of the hilly side. It is first of all a linear path way, an urban corridor, a slow infrastructure for daily strolls; and secondly an outline limit for future expansions, to be filled with units according to the village’s growth and needs.',

Just like a carpet, the base adapts to any topography and becomes part and parcel of the landscape.The project aims to valorise the local traditions and know how, adopting simple building techniques and local materials.Five pure objects stand separately and provide facilities for the community’s needs.  Between them, a game of little alleys and squares create a cluster of knowledge. Each function is separated and individual yet strongly connected to the other; like the atelier and the study hall with their facing entrances. The kitchen and the bathrooms are the only buildings with outwards facing entrances, due to their more specific functions. The collective kitchen provides a large chimney for baking, becoming now a symbol for of collective household.',
